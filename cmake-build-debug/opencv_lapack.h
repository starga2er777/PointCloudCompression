 * Using netlib's reference LAPACK implementation version >= 3.4.0 (first with C interface).
 * Use LAPACK_xxxx to transparently (via predefined lapack macros) deal with pre and post 3.9.1 versions.
 * LAPACK 3.9.1 introduces LAPACK_FORTRAN_STRLEN_END and modifies (through preprocessing) the declarations of the following functions used in opencv
 *        sposv_, dposv_, spotrf_, dpotrf_, sgesdd_, dgesdd_, sgels_, dgels_
 * which end up with an extra parameter.
 * So we also need to preprocess the function calls in opencv coding by prefixing them with LAPACK_.
 * The good news is the preprocessing works fine whatever netlib's LAPACK version.
