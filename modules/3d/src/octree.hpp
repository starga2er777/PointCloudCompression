/** @brief OctreeNode for Octree.

The class OctreeNode represents the node of the octree. Each node contains 8 children, which are used to divide the
space cube into eight parts. Each octree node represents a cube.
And these eight children will have a fixed order, the order is described as follows:

For illustration, assume,
    rootNode: origin == (0, 0, 0), size == 2
 Then,
    children[0]: origin == (0, 0, 0), size == 1
    children[1]: origin == (1, 0, 0), size == 1, along X-axis next to child 0
    children[2]: origin == (0, 1, 0), size == 1, along Y-axis next to child 0
    children[3]: origin == (1, 1, 0), size == 1, in X-Y plane
    children[4]: origin == (0, 0, 1), size == 1, along Z-axis next to child 0
    children[5]: origin == (1, 0, 1), size == 1, in X-Z plane
    children[6]: origin == (0, 1, 1), size == 1, in Y-Z plane
    children[7]: origin == (1, 1, 1), size == 1, furthest from child 0

There are two kinds of nodes in an octree, intermediate nodes and leaf nodes, which are distinguished by isLeaf.
Intermediate nodes are used to contain leaf nodes, and leaf nodes will contain pointers to all pointcloud data
within the node, which will be used for octree indexing and mapping from point clouds to octree. Note that,
in an octree, each leaf node contains at least one point cloud data. Similarly, every intermediate OctreeNode
contains at least one non-empty child pointer, except for the root node.

/** @brief Key for pointCloud, used to compute the child node index through bit operations.

When building the octree, the point cloud data is firstly voxelized/discretized: by inserting
all the points into a voxel coordinate system. For example, when resolution is set to 0.01, a point
with coordinate Point3f(0.251,0.502,0.753) would be transformed to:(0.251/0.01,0.502/0.01,0.753/0.01)
=(25,50,75). And the OctreeKey will be (x_key:1_1001,y_key:11_0010,z_key:100_1011). Assume the Octree->depth
is 100_0000, It can quickly calculate the index of the child nodes at each layer.
