Open Source Experience:

​	-[OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22682): Handling cases where the depth of Octree setting is too large


## About me

- I am a third-year undergraduate student at Southern University of Science and Technology. Under the guidance of Professor Shiqi Yu, I have accumulated experience in point cloud compression for a semester. This is also my research direction for this semester. Please believe that I have enough time and ability to complete this project.
- For this project, I plan to utilize an octree as the data structure to store the point cloud data. Currently, I have gained sufficient knowledge on the implementation of an `octree`in the `3d` module of `OpenCV5.x` and have made improvement suggestions that were accepted by the official team. Furthermore, I have studied the source code of Point Cloud Library (`PCL`) regarding point cloud compression and have acquired knowledge on some of the dynamic point cloud compression techniques they adopt, such as `double-buffered octree` compression.
- I have perused numerous scholarly articles concerning the compression of point clouds, which involve various compression techniques such as direct encoding, predictive encoding, and color compression. Furthermore, I have devised a corresponding solution for direct encoding. Additionally, I intend to abide by the `GPCC` encoding standard for the compression of point cloud data.
- I am adept at seeking help. In my research on Computer Version, Professor Shiqi Yu, Research assistants Zihao Mu, Wanli Zhong have provided me with valuable advice. When encountering bottlenecks, will seek advice in a timely manner. Additionally, when there are interim achievements, I will promptly report and listen to their feedback.

## Proposal

### Motivation

- Due to our team members' current progress in point cloud data compression in OpenCV-5.x, this GSoC project is a perfect fit for our direction. Therefore, team members would like to better accomplish this task with a mentor in the relevant filed. 
- Through this project, we would be able to receive feedbacks from not only mentors but also developers to contribute to the open-source community.



### Design

#### Overview

The above figure demonstrates the procedure of compression and decompression of point cloud data.

The procedure consists of five steps:

1. Preprocessing: In order to avoid the precision error, discretization is necessary since the data is composed by continuous float numbers. The data is thus mapped to discrete space.
2. Construction of octree: Octree is applied to store the data. User can specify the precision according to actual demand, the precision argument decides the depth of the octree.
3. Serialization: The complete information of octree is encoded by bit stream. Techniques like occupancy code, direct coding mode are applied to improve compression rate. 
4. Entropy Coding: Since the zero-one distribution in the bit stream is not uniform, entropy encoding is applied for further improvement.
5. Outputs: Output a bit stream.



#### Building The Octree

First, the point cloud data is discretized: we insert all the points into a voxel coordinate system.

For example, when precision is set to 0.01, a point with coordinate `Point3f(0.251,0.502,0.753)`  would transform to  `Point3i(25,50,75)`.

Next, the smallest bounding cube with side length $2^d$(d is octree's depth) that contains the point positions in internal coordinates is calculated.

For example, if the boundary points are `Point3f(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` and `Point3f(10.0, 10.0, 10.0)`, then the cube size would be 1024 and the included range would be `(0, 0, 0)` to `(10.24, 10.24, 10.24)`. The point ` (0.251, 0.502, 0.753) `  turns into `(25，50，75)` in the voxel system. Repeat the process for every point then the precision problem is easily solved. 



#### Methods to Encode/Decode Octree

Encoding is performed by serializing the octree to a byte vector. Each node of an octree can be represented by an occupancy code of eight bits, each bit representing whether a specific child is occupied (has a point in its volume). The byte vector is a sequence of occupancy codes generated by traversing in BFS order starting from the root. This order guarantees that we can reverse-build the same octree structure when decoding.

By using arithmetic entropy coding, the byte stream can be further compressed due to its non-uniform probability distribution. Our entropy encoder encodes and decodes the byte stream effectively.

Further achieving compression rate requires exploring spatial correlation (neighbor entropy coding), or choosing different coding methods. In practice, we find out that when octree's depth is deepened (to improve precision), most octree nodes is only occupied by one child, i.e. degenerate from subtree to a chain, because at that depth the space is finely separated by tiny octree nodes(like dense voxels), and points are isolated to each node, so no spatial correlation is taken into advantage. Thus, directly encoding the isolated points' positions is more efficient than using occupancy codes. This method is called "Direct Coding Mode" (DCM).



#### Methods to Encode Color

Our team are currently learning about Region-Adaptive Hierarchical Transform.



#### Current Progress

- Our team are familiar with octree related code in OpenCV-5.x and understand how it works. We have had an accepted pull request solving the octree depth error of OpenCV-5.x.
- Our team has developed a demo, which supports simple geometry compression.
- Our team has read a few papers and have some understanding of existing compression techniques such as DCM and double-buffering octree.
- Our team has been exploring the field of point cloud compression for six month under the guidance of Professor Shiqi Yu.
